# Capture-Attend
A face recognition attendance management website using Python, Open-CV, Django and SQLite for Microsoft Engage 2022.

# Engage2022
 This is project under Microsoft Engage 2022 Mentorship programme aimed at using Computer Vision to detect a face and mark the attendance of a student. The detector created is pretty   accurate and trains itself perfectly with just one picture that is uploaded by the respective student. The project runs on the server built using Django.
 This project can be used in educational institutions or work places to register students or employees with minimal manual work.
 
 ## Project Structure
  #### As instructed by my mentor, I have implemented a few elements of Agile methodology to ensure this project comes into shape
  Week 1 : Creation of the login page, creation of the database for saving information, implementing face recognition features and ensuring detection of faces.
  <br> Week 2: Getting the information and displaying it on the attendance report page, making sure that the details are printed correctly along with date.
<br> Week 3: Working on a system that would allow exporting the attendance report in the form of Excel sheet and doing any minor changes in the other portions to ensure smooth working.
<br> Week 4: Creating a sign up interface (I was working with making every new individual superuser which didnâ€™t seem efficient), final touches and plans to deploy.
